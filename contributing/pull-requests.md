# Pull Requests

Before opening a pull request, you will need to create a fork of the GitHub repository. Furthermore, you can follow the [Building guide](broken-reference) and add your own patches or features. Please make sure that no one else has already opened a pull request with the exact same patches or features.

### Guidelines

Please make sure to read the [Contributing Guidelines](guidelines.md).

### GitHub pull requests

Once your changes are made, open a pull request:

1. Navigate to your forked Sonar repository.
2. Click the **New pull request** button.
3. Use a clear and descriptive title for your pull request.
4. Provide a detailed description of the changes you made.
5. Reference related issues or pull requests.
6. Make sure everything is properly tested.
7. Open the pull request and wait for feedback.
