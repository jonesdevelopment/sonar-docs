description: Step-by-step guide on how to install Sonar on your server.

# Getting started

1. First, download the plugin.
2. Then, stop your server.
3. Open your server's plugins folder.
4. Drag and drop the Sonar jar file into the plugins folder.
5. Finally, start your server again. Sonar is now protecting your server!

You can [download the latest stable release](https://github.com/jonesdevelopment/sonar/releases/latest) from the [Sonar GitHub repository](https://github.com/jonesdevelopment/sonar/).

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you are utilizing a proxy (BungeeCord or Velocity), please **refrain from uploading Sonar to every backend server** as Sonar should only be run once for each new connection.
{% endhint %}
