# Supported versions

**Supported client versions**

* Minecraft 1.7.2-1.20.6

**Requirements**

* Velocity 3.3.0 (build 330 or above)
* BungeeCord (1.20 or above)
* Java 11 (or above)

**Disclaimer**

* It's possible that some highly altered server forks won't be supported.
* Some significantly modified Minecraft clients (including cheats) may interfere with the verification process. Since it is the client developer's duty to guarantee vanilla protocol, this cannot be fixed.
* ViaVersion on the proxy is not supported. (â†’ [Read more on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/923308209769426994/1213163875906625597))
