# Supported versions

**Supported client versions**

* Minecraft 1.7.2-1.21.1

**Requirements**

* Velocity 3.3.0 (build 330 or above)
* BungeeCord (1.20 or above)
* Spigot 1.8.8 (or above)
* Java 11 (or above)

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Disclaimer**

* It's possible that some highly altered server forks won't be supported.
* Some significantly modified Minecraft clients (including cheats) may interfere with the verification process. Since it is the client developer's duty to guarantee vanilla protocol, this cannot be fixed by Sonar.
* [Netty](https://netty.io/) versions below 4.1.x are not supported by Sonar.
