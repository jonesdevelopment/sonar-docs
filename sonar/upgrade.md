2. prioritized support via Discord (higher ticket priority),
3. and access to the Customer role on Discord.
   1. Access to a customer-dedicated help chat.
   2. Access to a bot support channel for simple questions or in-game related issues.

If you have any further questions, feel free to open a ticket on Discord.
